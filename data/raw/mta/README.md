The `remote_complex_lookup.csv` table was copied from this git repository:

https://github.com/qri-io/data-stories-scripts/tree/master/nyc-turnstile-counts

As described in this medium article:

This was the result of a manual effort on their part, which at this time is still up to date.

The `stations.csv` table also came from their repository, and is based on this official MTA source:

Thank you to the original creators!
